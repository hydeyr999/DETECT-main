        "We're already looking forward to a brand new Premier League campaign - but what can we expect to be different next time round? Sky Sports News HQ understands that next month Premier League clubs will discuss increasing the numbers of substitutes allowed on match days, from seven to nine. Clubs will still only be allowed to use three substitutes - but we understand Manchester United and Chelsea are leading the push to add another two subs to the bench. In 2008, the Premier League increased the numbers of subs allowed from five to seven. The proposals will be discussed at the Premier League's AGM in June. This will be the first shareholders meeting for some time for Burnley, Middlesbrough and either Hull or Sheffield Wednesday. Other things we know will be new for next season include live and exclusive Friday night Premier League football from Sky Sports. A total of 10 Premier League matches will be shown here on Sky Sports on Friday nights throughout the season. Other changes for the next campaign will include a brand new substitute board - complete with a new sponsor in Tag Heuer. Nike will launch the new 2016-2017 Premier League ball later this summer and the new Premier League logo will be seen everywhere - including on the sleeves of all players - and without the Barclays logo after the title sponsorship deal came to an end.",

        "Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Police on Thursday detained two migrant labourers in connection with the death of 30-year-old Dalit woman, who was allegedly raped and brutally murdered in Perumbavoor. The Kerala government has formed a 20-member team to probe the case. The Deputy Superintendent of Police of Perumbavoor area has also been replaced to handle law and order situation.

And though McNeal missed the Iowa State game due to a football injury, it looks like he's healthy once again. With play caller Jay Norvell promising to play more young players after expressing frustration with the blocking effort and senior leadership of his players, McNeal could see more reps against Kansas. If the Longhorns are able to jump out to an early lead, it would be even easier for Norvell to justify playing more of the freshmen and sophomores. McNeal was a consensus four-star prospect out of high school who was considered the nation's No. 20 athlete by the 247Sports Composite rankings.

        "With a success under its belt with the Chromecast, Google is officially renewing its assault on the living room with Android TV. Running atop Android L, Android TV will run on hardware a la Google TV and set-top boxes like Apple TV and Roku and consoles, but with an added focus on gaming. Today's announcement confirms details gleaned by The Verge this past April. Google TV, launched in 2010 with its apparent ambition to turn your television into a smartphone, is now firmly in the past. Android TV is Google's rekindled vision for your home's largest screen, and it's considerably sleeker and more in line with the competition's offerings. Entertainment is paramount this time around, as the software surfaces content from the Google Play Store and requisite partners like Netflix and Hulu, and provides recommendations based on what you watch. Search is also baked into the experience, using Google's Knowledge Graph to provide contextual information for your favorite programs. Users can even control the software using an Android Wear watch, and, much like the Chromecast, content can be sent from a separate device to Android TV. Mountain View is also bringing Google Play games to television, confirming an earlier report by the Wall Street Journal. Like the Fire TV, devices will come with a controller, and gamers will be able to play multiplayer games online and earn achievements via the Google Play Games network. In addition, Google is working with hardware OEMs like Sony and Sharp to design TVs slated for 2015, and Razer and Asus to develop the set-top boxes with a focus on gaming.",

Alternating Currents festival will replace the two day music festival River Roots Live and no longer be conjoined with Ribfest. Instead Ribfest will join Street Fest. Those are just some of the major changes to festival including the music being indoors. Along with music, the new festival will now feature stand up comedy acts, film screenings and visual artists. More than 50 local and national acts will perform throughout the festival and organizers are releasing the line-up later this spring. \"It allows us to really showcase the creative talent that we have here in the quad cities,\" says Jason Gilliland, Director of the Downtown Davenport Partnership. And while people are enjoying the different acts Gilliland says it could get downtown Davenport more attention. \"It should be a lot of fun. We'll have a lot more content and different things for people to kind of explore. And while you're moving around and finding some of the different acts performing you can learn more about the downtown,\" says Gilliland. The dates for the festival are to remain the same weekend on August 26th and 27th. For more information on the Alternating Currents Festival Click Here.",

After an 1884 ruling that cremation was lawful in England the LNC also took advantage of its proximity to Woking Crematorium by providing transport for bodies and mourners on its railway line and after 1910 by interring ashes in a dedicated columbarium. The LNC also provided the land for a number of significant military cemeteries and memorials at Brookwood after both World Wars.

        "A couple of years ago, some friends and I took a road trip from the east coast to the southwest. We spent about two weeks across the Mexican border in the state of Chihuahua, mostly in Ciudad Juarez. It was here where I first tasted horchata- creamy, sweet, and so refreshing in the summer heat. I've been trying to recreate that experience ever since with all sorts of powders and boxed rice milks, but it wasn't until I stumbled upon this recipe that I was really taken back to Juarez. As far as I know, this recipe is very authentic, with evaporated milk thrown in for an extra creamy punch. Trust me, your friends and family will be amazed! All of the ingredients are cheap and easy to find. One thing you should make sure you have for this recipe is a cheesecloth, which can be found in the baking section of most grocery stores. If you don't drink milk, this horchata is still good without the evaporated milk, just increase the sugar to about 1 cup or to taste.",

And interestingly, these relationships often disintegrated over time anyway. Perhaps this was because others sensed my resentment. Or maybe my behavior ensured that my relationships were superficial and thus not very rewarding since I did not share my feelings and needs with the other. Or possibly the relationships fell by the wayside over time because of my own fatigue and anger from always accommodating.

        "Everyone hates CAPTCHAs, those garbled text images that you must retype to prove you're a human being. At best they're an annoyance, but often they are downright incomprehensible. And the worst part is that attackers are getting around them fairly easily. Today Leap Marketing Technologies announces NuCaptcha, a CAPTCHA that uses a video instead of a still image. Users are instructed to type a few of the moving characters on the screen. Try it yourself, after the jump. NuCaptcha Demo Leap claims that humans are good at making such distinctions, but that automating the reading of such images would be very difficult. In fact, while there have been many attempts to automate the reading of CAPTCHAs, Leap says this isn't how it's done in the real world. A New York Times article from April claims that CAPTCHA reading sweat shops in India, Bangladesh and China have become popular with spammers and this is where the action is. But the economics of such outsourcing depend on the workers being able to solve a certain minimum number of CAPTCHAs, NuCaptcha can mess with these economics by increasing the time of the video before it can be solved if the system detects signs of a CAPTCHA factory. All these settings are controllable by the site administrators. NuCaptcha is not alone in trying to defeat such systems, but if they really can increase the time to solve in such cases and not affect normal users too much with it, then they could make CAPTCHA factories unprofitable.",

The group approached photographers Ryan Kang and Taylor Wilder last year about shooting images for a \"sexy calendar,\" according to Kang's Instagram account. Though the calendar never made it to production, Kang released the photos Thursday. As you might guess, the images are rather eye-catching. Among the highlights: nine players -- one sporting a laurel crown -- draped in togas and feeding each other grapes; a lumberjack ensemble featuring a chainsaw, an axe and a shirtless, suspenders-clad center preparing to hike a log; and a pool party complete with inflatable tubes, boogie boards and fishing gear. You can see all 12 photos here. Perhaps the Ducks road-graders were inspired by the 2008 O-line, which took part in a similar production. That group drew plenty of attention, so much so that the players had to turn the focus away from their calendar and back to football. We can only imagine this new round of snapshots will attract similar fanfare.",

Gemasolar uses 2650 mirrors to concentrate the sun's rays on to the top of a central ''power tower'' and heat salt to more than 500 degrees.

        "Labour MP Lianne Dalziel has asked the founder of Christchurch's Student Volunteer Army, Sam Johnson, to stand together to challenge Mayor Bob Parker in this year's local body elections, The Press understands. Speculation has been mounting as to who will run against Parker in October. And The Press can now reveal Labour's Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokeswoman Dalziel has asked Johnson, 24, to be her running mate and would-be deputy mayor. Johnson himself would have to be elected as a councillor to assume the deputy's position, and Dalziel is believed to have sounded out other running mates too. But Johnson's reputation soared after he organised the much-celebrated student army to help quake-affected Cantabrians and in 2012 he was named Young New Zealander of the Year. He currently sits on the Riccarton-Wigram Community Board and in January indicated he could seek a seat on the city council . \"I'm not ruling it out but I haven't made a decision about it,\" Johnson told The Press at the time. Neither Dalziel nor Johnson would comment last night. However, Johnson is believed to have confided in a handful of city leaders yesterday. In a March interview with The Press, Dalziel indicated a mayoral bid was unlikely, but not definitely off the table. In recent weeks, city councillor Tim Carter also emerged as a viable challenger to Parker, launching campaign-style attacks, and branding the incumbent as having a \"very poor record\".",
        "A chemical fire that started after an explosion at a cargo warehouse in Brazil has been put out after two days. The fire in Santos spread toxic gas over the country's biggest port and across four cities. The company owners said the containers were full of acid and a disinfectant which came into contact with rainwater, causing a reaction. Reports say close to 200 people in three cities were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. Prosecutors are now investigating whether anyone is to blame for the fire, that more than 300 firefighters battled at its peak. The container terminal was operated by Localfrio, a logistics company, in Guaruja, a municipality on the eastern side of Santos, in Sao Paulo state. A spokeswoman for the company, which exports chemicals used for refrigeration and general cargo, said the containers were filled with chloric acid and sodium dichloroisocyanurate - a cleaning and disinfectant agent. Reports in Guaruja said 85 containers on the site were damaged. Local mayor Maria Antonieta de Brito had asked people to stay out of the rain which could \"contain chemical elements that can burn the skin\".",

        "Arsenal tried to take Ramadan Sobhi on trial earlier this year. Stoke City have made a bid for highly rated teenager Ramadan Sobhi, sources from Egypt have told ESPN FC. Sobhi, who currently plies his trade for Al Ahly, is regarded as one of the best young talents to emerge from Egypt and his form has alerted a number of clubs in Europe. Arsenal and Italian side Roma have been long-term admirers of Sobhi with Arsenal failing in a bid to take the 18-year-old on trial earlier this year. Sobhi broke into the Egyptian national team at the age of 17 and to date has scored one goal in six appearances for his country. Stoke scouts have watched Sobhi in action in recent weeks and they have firmed up their interest by tabling an offer for the attacking midfielder as they look to beat their rivals to his signature. Stoke boss Mark Hughes has been busy bringing in some exciting talents such as Xherdan Shaqiri and Bojan Krkic to the Britannia Stadium in recent years and he sees Sobhi as someone who can prove a valuable addition to his plans.

        "Millions of Indonesian children are being vaccinated this week as the country responds to a widespread diphtheria outbreak that has killed dozens, officials said Monday. Some eight million children and teenagers across the Southeast Asian nation will receive the shot to prevent further spread of the disease which is caused by a bacterial infection. It can lead to breathing difficulties, heart failure, paralysis, and even death if left untreated. Widespread incidents of the communicable disease are relatively rare in Indonesia, although it had the second largest number of reported cases globally from 2011-2015, behind India, according to the World Health Organization. This year, nearly 600 cases have been detected in 95 Indonesian communities across 20 provinces, killing 32 people. The vaccination programme started from Monday in three of the country's most populous provinces, including the capital Jakarta, and could continue into next month, officials said. The spike in cases is due to poor public awareness as well as a growing anti-vaccination movement in Indonesia, the health ministry said. \"Diphtheria cases have been rare for a long time in Indonesia, so people were no longer aware of the danger and did not take their children for vaccinations,\" senior ministry official Jane Soepardi told AFP. Officials hope to halt the spread before Indonesia hosts the Asian Games next year. \"It was not scary at all. My teacher told me we all must be vaccinated and it did not hurt either,\" Ragil Setiawan, a 10-year-old student at an elementary school in Tangerang, just outside of Jakarta, said Monday after getting his shot.",

        "The young founder of El Compadre, a recently opened offshoot of the critically acclaimed South Philly Barbacoa, tragically passed away Wednesday at the age of 23, family members shared on Facebook. Isaias Berriozabal-Martinez, son of South Philly Barbacoa owners Christina Martinez and Benjamin Miller, died at his parents' home Wednesday morning of causes that have yet to be determined. Last October, Berriozabal-Martinez opened El Compadre at 1149 S. 9th Street in what was celebrated as a revival of South Philly Barbacoa's in-demand torta catering business. He had been a fixture at South Philly Barbacoa and had saved up enough money to run El Compadre during the three years since he immigrated to the United States to join Miller and Martinez. Like his mother, Berriozabal-Martinez was an undocumented Mexican immigrant who braved a dangerous trek to the United States from his hometown of Capulhuac. El Compadre's menu of tortas was inspired by the local culinary scene of his hometown and neighboring Toluca. Miller and Martinez have been vocal advocates for the rights of undocumented workers in the United States, hosting workshops and film screenings to serve South Philly Barbacoa's patrons, many of whom hail from Mexico and ritually eat at the restaurant on weekends. South Philly Barbacoa announced on Facebook that it will hold nine nights of vigils at the restaurant.",

        "As the recovery of his ship progresses, Capt Schettino is believed to be at home with his wife in the seaside town of Meta di Sorrento, near Naples. His trial, in which he faces charges of manslaughter and abandoning ship, started in July in Grosseto in Tuscany, the closest city to the scene of the disaster. He claims that the rocky reef that the ship hit on the night of Jan 13 2012 was not marked on his nautical charts - despite the fact that it appears on tourist maps of Giglio. At the hearing, his lawyer denied that the captain had deliberately abandoned ship, instead insisting that the skipper had been inadvertently thrown off the ship by accident. Capt Schettino has previously claimed that he accidentally \"tripped\" and tumbled into a lifeboat, which was then lowered and took him to shore. \"The idea that he abandoned the ship is a wrong interpretation,\" Mr Pepe, Schettino's lawyer, said outside court. \"We want the truth to come out of this trial\". Capt Schettino says he has been made a scapegoat by Costa Cruises, the Italian company that owns the ship, claiming that managers encouraged him to sail close to Giglio in order to provide a spectacle for passengers. There is currently a long break in legal proceedings over the summer, with the trial set to reconvene on Monday 23 September. Up to 700 witnesses and plaintiffs are expected to attend the trial, meaning it could last for years.",
        "Greens leader Richard Di Natale has proposed a direct levy on coal miners to fund \"billions of dollars\" in environmental rehabilitation work on former coal mine and storage sites as well as the retraining of coal industry workers for the clean energy jobs of the future. In one of its most important policy markers leading into the pre-election period for a 2016 poll, Dr Di Natale will unveil the plan on Tuesday and will use an address to the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday to flesh out the details. Mine site rehabilitation is extremely expensive. Credit:Robert Rough \"As coal companies go bankrupt or leave Australia, it is coal workers who are hit the hardest, followed by state governments, who are regularly left to foot the bill for cleaning up the mine,\" Dr Di Natale said. The compulsory payments, likely to be opposed by the industry and the federal government as a form of industry-specific carbon tax, would contribute to \"a Federal Trust Fund for the companies to access at the conclusion of their operations\".",
        "Private school teachers are being stalked to their homes during the weekend and harassed via email and SMS by helicopter parents anxious about their children's homework.

These expectations of teachers rose as the child moved through school. School's out, but some parents still expect teachers to be on duty when there's homework to be done. Credit:Leah Anne Thompson \"Teachers were seen as falling short in their actual responsibility in the higher grades,\" researcher Judith Locke said. Ms Locke said overly involved parents could be too invested in their child's academic achievements, \"which may result in excessive emotional reactions if the academic expectations are not fulfilled\", and a tendency to blame the school for their child's failings.",

        "Carter is the fourth defensive starter to be put on injured reserve with Lee, safety Barry Church and defensive end Kenyon Coleman. Cornerback Orlando Scandrick remains on the active roster despite undergoing left hand surgery last Friday. One of the Cowboys' strengths coming into this season was their linebacker corps, with DeMarcus Ware and Anthony Spencer on the outside in their 3-4 scheme and Lee and Carter on the inside. Overall roster depth is not among Dallas' strengths, and so the losses of their two starting inside linebackers isn't going to be easy for them to overcome. They will need to rely even more on Brandon Carr and rookie Morris Claiborne as shutdown cornerbacks to help cover their weaknesses up front and at safety, and there are liable to be games down the stretch in which the league's No. 8-ranked defense gives up more yards and points than it should to apparently inferior opponents. This latest significant injury on defense also puts more pressure on Tony Romo and the Cowboys' offense to deliver more consistent production, something that could be helped if running back DeMarco Murray ever returns from his foot injury. The Cowboys are 5-6, two games out of first place in the NFC East and one game behind the NFC's final wild-card spot with five games to play. They host the Eagles this Sunday night.",
        "The world governing body has identified and approached at least one prospective member in recent weeks for the temporary panel that could replace FFA chairman Steven Lowy and his board. The person is Australian, going some way to allaying fears FIFA could put overseas administrators in charge with no knowledge of the sport's domestic intricacies and issues. FIFA would not comment when asked to confirm if it had begun speaking to potential normalisation committee members. \"As a general rule we do not comment on such matters,\" a FIFA spokesperson told AAP. However, appointing locals instead of bringing in outsiders would be consistent with FIFA's prior behaviour. The sport's world governing body usually looks to former lawyers, politicians or business people from that country - often with a background in the administration of football, the Olympics or other sports - when installing normalisation committees. Cameroon, Argentina and Guinea have all seen such interventions from FIFA in the past 18 months. In any event, a normalisation committee would be an interim measure, tasked with overseeing reform to FFA's congress and running the sport's daily affairs before holding fresh elections in which none of its members could stand in. With two months until the FIFA-imposed deadline on November 30, it is becoming an increasingly real proposition. Talks are continuing among the three stakeholders - the A-League clubs, state federations and Professional Footballers Australia - to find consensus on how an expanded congress should be structured. But the A-League clubs hold the whip hand and can simply stall to achieve their desired outcome of regime change at FFA. The latest proposal from the nine state federations, for a 9-4-1-1 split of votes, has been rejected by the clubs and PFA because it would mean the states still have the power to elect FFA board members on their own.",

Speaking at a conference titled: 'India and Korea: New Prospects for Bilateral Co-operation', the Ambassador called for strategic partnership between India and South Korea in strategic areas. \"India and Korea share common cultural, political and economic values. Right from having a political system based on liberal democracy to the cultural pathos, both the countries have a lot in common. \"The strengths of the Indian economy like defence, space research and airpower as well as Korea's strong shipping industry, can reap combined benefits for both the regions,\" he said. Lee also noted the importance of Indo-South Korean cooperation in the fields of nuclear energy and maritime security. \"Both India and Korea can exchange help with respect to nuclear energy and share crucial information among each other regarding maritime security.

On the other side are representatives from Dish Network, Sky Angel, Netflix, Roku and Public Knowledge. So yeah, this could get interesting. The NCTA has already starting posturing on its blog, Cable Tech Talk, with a post highlighting all the wonderful changes in the video distribution industry in the past 20 years -- however, curiously, the upwardly creeping price of the average bill wasn't mentioned. Of course a subcommittee hearing is just the first of a very long process towards real change, and while we'd be shocked if any of our ideas are implemented anytime soon, it's good to see some movement in Washington on a topic we care about.",
        "Bicycles have the upper hand on cars in that they're safer for the environment, healthier for the user, and generally have an easier time getting around in dense urban settings. One area where bikes will always lose to cars, however, is weight. Bikes aren't heavy enough to trigger the underground sensors that change traffic lights, so at many intersections, a cyclist has to either wait for a car to come, push the pedestrian crossing button, or blow through the red light. The City of Rochester is looking to change that by installing cameras that detect when a bicycle is stopped at an intersection and trigger the process to change the light. The plan is to use the cameras on bike boulevards, a series of connected streets that help cyclists avoid main roads. Rochester has been proactive in terms of fostering a bike culture and has implemented many innovations to make life easier and safer for the local cycling community. The cameras are the latest example. Two cameras have been installed so far: one at the intersection of Monroe Avenue and Canterbury Road, and the other at Harvard Street and Culver Road. Canterbury and Harvard are part of Rochester's first bike boulevard, and speed humps, bike markings, and bike wayfinding signs have been installed on these streets, too. Erik Frisch, the city's transportation specialist, says that more detection cameras will go up as more boulevard miles are created. The city plans a total of 53 miles, he says. In addition to bike boulevards, Frisch says, cameras could be used at intersections with bike boxes. The boxes are spaces at the front of intersections where cyclists can pull ahead of cars and wait for the light to change. \"It gives bikes a little head start and a little more visibility if they're in the intersection,\" Frisch says.",

Selina Hodge posted a plea online in July asking for someone to donate a kidney. The 28-year-old then turned to the Craigslist classified ad website. She told Florida television station WPTV she \"didn't know where else to turn\". Hodge received more than 800 responses from all over the world from her Craigslist ad. One came from 23-year-old Stephanie Grant, who lived just a few kilometres away from Hodge in Palm Beach Gardens.

        "PITTSBURGH -- Jordan Staal wanted a family reunion, and the Pittsburgh Penguins obliged. The Penguins traded the talented center to the Carolina Hurricanes for two players and Carolina's first-round pick in the NHL draft that was held in Pittsburgh on Friday night. The 23-year-old Staal helped the Penguins win the Stanley Cup in 2009, but reportedly balked at signing a contract extension. Staal has one season left on his current four-year deal. Rather than continue negotiating, the Penguins shipped him to the Hurricanes, where Staal will join brother Eric Staal. Carolina also has Jared Staal -- currently playing in the American Hockey League. Pittsburgh received center Brandon Sutter and defenseman Brian Dumoulin in the deal as well as Carolina's eighth-overall pick in the draft, which the Penguins used to select defenseman Derrick Pouliot. On a day when speculation about the future of Columbus star Rick Nash abounded, it was the Penguins who provided the draft with a jolt by sending the popular Staal packing. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman hinted at the impact moments before announcing the trade. Penguins general manager Ray Shero thanked Staal for his contributions to the franchise before taking Pouliot as the capacity crowd at Consol Energy Center roared its approval. The move is a stunning end to a hugely successful run in Pittsburgh for Staal, the team's sixth pick in the 2006 draft who is getting married this weekend with most of his former Penguins teammates expected to attend.",

The report quotes Additional District Magistrate Rajesh Yadav who says that one of the five accused is Vishal, son of local BJP leader Sanjay Rana. The rumour that beef was stored in Akhlaq's house was announced by the priest of a local temple. According to the family members of Akhlaq, Vishal coerced the priest to make the announcement. The priest has already gone on record to say that he was forced to do so. However according to the police, the priest is repeatedly changing his version of how the event unfolded. BJP leader Sanjay Rana has refuted all allegations saying Akhlaq was like his brother and he intimated the police about the horrific lynching incident. He claims to be a dedicated member of the party with association spanning over 20 years. BJP though claims that currently Rana is not holding any party post.

        "Using a digital tracking microscope that provides both cell position and orientation, we have correlated the detailed motion of the cell body of a fast-swimming bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, with its swimming motility. Contrary to the prevailing view that the rotating flagellum is the only means to propel the cell, we show that when the flagellum pushes the cell, the axis of the cell body precesses with a helical trajectory that enhances motility. This discovery changes our understanding regarding the role that cell shape and motion plays in bacterial motility. Furthermore, our powerful cell tracking technique enables a wide variety of studies that require extended observation of single cells, including motility, cell behavior, and aging. Abstract We resolve the 3D trajectory and the orientation of individual cells for extended times, using a digital tracking technique combined with 3D reconstructions. We have used this technique to study the motility of the uniflagellated bacterium Caulobacter crescentus and have found that each cell displays two distinct modes of motility, depending on the sense of rotation of the flagellar motor. In the forward mode, when the flagellum pushes the cell, the cell body is tilted with respect to the direction of motion, and it precesses, tracing out a helical trajectory. In the reverse mode, when the flagellum pulls the cell, the precession is smaller and the cell has a lower translation distance per rotation period and thus a lower motility. Using resistive force theory, we show how the helical motion of the cell body generates thrust and can explain the direction-dependent changes in swimming motility. The source of the cell body precession is believed to be associated with the flexibility of the hook that connects the flagellum to the cell body.",

The rabies cases in raccoons are the first seen in Ontario in over a decade. The Ministry has said they expected to find other cases in the same area as time goes on. The rabies outbreak only came to light after two dogs got into a fight with a sick raccoon in the back of an animal services van.

As the Abbott government prepares to strike down part of the racial discrimination law, the Monash University study has found many migrants regularly fear walking alone at night or becoming a victim of crime. The survey, to be released on Monday, is the latest in a series ''mapping social cohesion'' funded by the Scanlon Foundation and the federal government, and the first to allow researchers to compare the experience of recent migrants to the wider Australian population. It shows migrants settling over the past two decades often feel singled out because of their skin colour or faith - and report a disturbing lack of trust, both in other people and political institutions compared to the rest of the population.",

        "World number one Andy Murray has pulled out of his first exhibition match at Hurlingham Club with a sore hip. The Briton, who was knocked out in the first round at Queen's last week, was due to play France's Lucas Pouille at the Aspall Tennis Classic. Murray is still expected to play on Friday before he begins the defence of his Wimbledon title on 3 July. The 30-year-old last played at Hurlingham in 2014 after he lost in the last 16 at Queen's. Elsewhere, world number two Novak Djokovic managed just nine minutes of play against Canadian Vasek Pospisil at Eastbourne before rain led to play being cancelled for the day. The Serb, appearing in his first pre-Wimbledon tournament for seven years, was forced to save two break points in his opening service game. Elsewhere, Britons Katie Swan and Tara Moore were knocked out of Wimbledon qualifying. Analysis BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller This is an \"ultra-cautious\" decision according to Murray's team, and it's expected he will play his other scheduled match at the Hurlingham Club on Friday. Murray has been practising at Wimbledon in recent days - with young Canadian Denis Shapovalov amongst others - but the disruption is far from ideal given his first-round exit at Queen's Club last week. It means Murray will have a maximum of two matches on grass before he begins the defence of his Wimbledon title.",

        "In 1884 near Tantanoola in South Australia's south east a Bengal tiger supposedly escaped from a travelling circus. A search was mounted, but the tiger was never found. Over the next few years, there were many reports of missing sheep in the area and some suggested that the sheep had become the prey of the missing tiger. Eleven years after the tiger went missing a local man, Tom Donovan, saw what he thought was the Bengal tiger in a paddock with a sheep in its jaws. He took a shot at it with his gun and shot the animal in the side. As it turns out, it was not a Bengal tiger, but a Eurasian wolf - equally out of place in the Australian environment. It is thought that the wolf was a stowaway on a boat that was shipwrecked off the coast, but managed to make it to the shore. The wolf was stuffed and is now on display at the Tantanoola Hotel. For fifteen years after the shooting of the wolf, however, sheep continued to go missing from the area. A policeman from Adelaide eventually went to investigate and arrested a local man for sheep stealing.",

        "Another CRT construct Stovall employs is voice. He does so by privileging the experiential knowledge of his students and allowing them to use their real-world racialized experiences as the starting point for discussions about race. While this technique seems logical, Stovall points out that oftentimes educators inadvertently privilege the dense theoretical readings on race in an attempt to help students understand the complexities and nuances of the concept. Instead, Stovall states that although he uses these theoretical texts in his syllabus, they serve as a reference rather than a focal point. By allowing the students to enter the discussion at a point where they are most comfortable expressing their knowledge, Stovall is not only summoning a principle of CRT but also, perhaps more notably, exhibiting his keen understanding of how students learn.",

        "Imagine a world in which your every move could be monitored by the government. You might board the train in the morning, switch to the bus to get to the office, later take a ferry to a client meeting. Across all modes of public transport, every one of your journeys would be tracked and stored in an ever-growing database that holds a detailed profile of your whereabouts. If this sounds like an over-dramatised scene from a Hollywood movie, or an only-in-America National Security Agency-style surveillance, think again. It could soon be you, once the NSW government introduces the Opal card payment system. The card will replace paper tickets on all Sydney public transport. It is now being tried on ferries, a trial on one train line starts on Friday and it will progressively be introduced across more of the NSW network by the end of next year. The government's aim is \"to make travelling an easy and convenient customer experience\". The idea is that customers no longer have to queue for paper tickets. You simply load money onto your Opal card and swipe at the gates or when entering and leaving a bus. You can also link your Opal card to your credit card for automatic top-ups. So far, the public debate on the Opal system revolves around its claimed benefits, its costs, and whether or not travel will become more expensive for users. What has gone largely unnoticed so far is the fact that Opal might well be the largest people-tracking system ever implemented in Australia.",

However, remarkably, the psychological dimensions of man, despite their importance, have had very little business impact. There are no multinational corporations that make it their task to guide us to the meaning of life, or to help us to be good and kind or to lead us through our rites of passage, from birth to death.

There will be some degree of contagion between the segmented risks. For example, Internet financial enterprises cannot obtain sufficient funds at reasonable cost in time to cope with the growth of assets or to pay the debts due, thus causing the risk of capital chain breaking, which may be caused by investor relationships, as well as interest rate risk and market cycle. From the perspective of external impact, business risk types will generate cross-class contagion with other risk types, mainly reflected in credit risk types and enterprise operation risk types. For example, the performance of Internet finance affects the health of its capital flow. This is because a large number of platforms attract users through financing and subsidies in the process of business development, which makes the health of capital flow within the platform extremely important.",

Many of those killed in the incident in the state capital of Patna were women and children, Bihar chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh told the BBC. He said 24 others were taken to the state hospital with injuries. The stampede broke out in Patna's Gandhi Maidan, as celebrations for the festival of Dussehra were being held. It is not yet clear what caused the incident, with reports suggesting it occurred in a narrow road as crowds dispersed from the outdoor venue. Eyewitnesses quoted by India's NDTV say the stampede started after word spread through the crowd that an electrical wire had snapped off and fallen down. Local journalist Niraj Sahay, who was at the scene, says an eyewitness told him that only one of the exits was opened for people to leave. The stampede started when some wires fell on the crowd, which people thought were electricity wires, he tells BBC Hindi. Hindu festivals in India are notorious for deadly stampedes, with large crowds often gathering in confined spaces. Crowd control is sometimes poor, with casualties from stampedes in some cases running into hundreds, BBC South Asia editor Jill McGivering says. In August 10 people were killed in another stampede at the Hindu festival of Somvati Amavasya in central India. In October 2013 some 91 pilgrims, mostly women and children, were killed in a stampede at a Hindu festival near the Ratangarh temple in Madhya Pradesh state.",

He made one attempt to break through the blockade on 23 December, but it proved impossible to do as the Union controlled every channel from Savannah, aided by their occupation of Tybee Island at the mouth of the Savannah River. Bulloch reported to Mallory in late January 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so Mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to Europe some other way.",

        "The big banks have pledged to overhaul bonuses paid to their retail staff to try to get better outcomes for customers, but the move has already drawn criticism for not going far enough. The Sedgwick Retail Banking Remuneration Review, commissioned by the peak body for Australia's banks, the Australian Bankers' Association, recommended on Wednesday that staff should no longer receive bonuses for simply hitting sales targets and the sales commissions given to third party mortgage brokers be replaced with a fee for service model. The review, by former Australian public service commissioner Stephen Sedgwick, follows a string of scandals in the banking sector linked to staff commissions, including inappropriate financial advice, aggressive loan marketing tactics and insurance policy switching. It also comes amid calls for a royal commission into the sector by the ALP and the Greens over bad banking behaviour.",
        "When Supergirl first made her way to the CW, fans couldn't help but wonder if she would crossover again with the other DC shows as she did with The Flash during her first season on CBS. To say fans were elated when they found out that all four shows would be involved in one this year would be an understatement, and it looks like production is already underway. Legends of Tomorrow actress Caity Lotz shared a new picture via Twitter with Supergirl's Melissa Benoist with the caption \"Seriously Super\". Both are in their respective costumes, and the crossover will most likely take place in the mid to late season, so they very well could be shooting it right now. Of course, it could be a shot from their promotional trailers for The CW, but for now the former seems more likely. As for what to expect from the upcoming event, executive producer Marc Guggenheim told fans about the crossovers premise.",
        "In response to the widely publicized complaints from TV viewers and broadcasters of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Waves is proud to unveil a solution which dramatically reduces the problematic sound of the omnipresent Vuvuzela trumpet favored by South African soccer fans. Working in conjunction with a major television broadcaster, we've precision-crafted a preset processing chain which drastically decreases Vuvuzela noise: The WNS Waves Noise Suppressor and the Q10 Equalizer. Together, they not only minimize Vuvuzela noise, they increase the intelligibility of the game announcers' play-by-play action and color commentary. The processing chain for Vuvuzela noise reduction is now available as load-and-use sessions for Pro Tools, Waves MultiRack, and Cubase. WNS Waves Noise Suppressor is a real-time noise reduction plugin which is unsurpassed for noise suppression in both indoor and outdoor environments with constant or modulating noise. Originally engineered for reducing noise from dialogue in film and video, WNS has since proven itself invaluable as a broadcast tool. WNS Waves Noise Suppressor Q10 Equalizer delivers precision equalization in any audio situation: broadcast, recording, mixing, mastering, and more. With power and features that far surpass the capabilities of analog gear, the Q10 lets you create spectral modifications that range from subtle to extreme. Q10 Equalizer How It Works A combination of dynamic broadband noise suppression and notch filtering are utilized to create the Vuvuzela noise reduction processing chain. Routing schemes and parameter settings were painstakingly adjusted, contrasted and, compared; multiple instances of each plugin, with different settings, were ultimately used to achieve optimal results.",

        "The idea of making just one actor or actress the lynchpin of a feature-length movie is enough to turn most filmmakers pants-on-head levels of crazy. It's one thing to make a successful film with an entire ensemble at your fingertips, but it's quite another to create something magnificent - or even watchable - with one lone performer. These \"one-man shows\" are a painful viewing experience when they don't work out, especially once the initial gimmickry falls away to reveal an underwhelming story or a mediocre performance. Because these types of movies succeed or fail based entirely on those two things: Story and performance. It's crucial that both of those elements knock it out of the park, because there are no other distractions for the audience to get swept away by. And once the viewers are lost, there's really nothing left to reel them back in. On the other hand, when it works, this strange sub-genre of dramatic film can be a truly, uniquely satisfying experience. Sometimes it's even enough to redefine an actor's career. Now in the interest of transparency, some of the films on this list do technically have more than one actor on the roster - occasional cameos or supporting voice actors, that sort of thing - but for the most part, it's all on the shoulders of just one man or woman.",

        "If you're somebody who likes to crack your knuckles before tackling a tough task, listen up. A study led by researchers at the University of Alberta has cracked the secret behind the popping sound knuckles make when they're cracked. The secret to the sound is a momentary, vacuum-like gap formed in the lubricating synovial fluid between the finger and knuckle bones. When the joints are pulled apart too far, a momentary gas-filled gap forms in between, triggering the sound. Lead author and U of A professor Greg Kawchuk says the \"pull my finger\" study could lead to future breakthroughs in joint health, including better analysis of spinal injuries, knee problems and other joint difficulties. \"It may be that we can use this new discovery to see when joint problems begin long before symptoms start,\" Kawchuk said in a statement. Kawchuk's international team of scientists used MRI scans to watch a knuckle crack in super-slow motion. A video of the MRI shows a momentary pocket of darkness between the knuckle and finger bones as they are pulled apart. \"You can actually see very clearly what is happening inside the joints,\" said Kawchuk. The MRI also revealed a brief flash of white just before the cracking sound occurs. Kawchuk says no one has ever observed that flash before, and he hopes to analyze it further with more powerful MRI machines in the future. Scientists say the force generated by knuckle-cracking is enough to damage a hard surface. However, medical research has found no ill effects in people who indulge their knuckle-cracking habit. Kawchuk says the study findings will form the basis of further research into joint health and arthritic pain. \"The ability to crack your knuckles could be related to joint health,\" he said. Kawchuk is an expert in spinal structure and function with a PhD in bioengineering. The study is published in the April 15 edition of the journal PLOS ONE.",

        "Germany has threatened to stop contributing development aid to countries that refuse to take back rejected asylum seekers. The move comes in response to failings which kept the suspected Berlin Christmas market attacker from being deported to Tunisia. \"Those who do not cooperate sufficiently cannot hope to benefit from our development aid,\" Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told German weekly Der Spiegel in an interview published at the weekend. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told ARD public television on Sunday that he \"fully supports this idea\". The warning was aimed in particular at Tunisia - the home nation of Anis Amri, who was suspected of ploughing a lorry into a Berlin Christmas market last month in an attack that killed 12 people - and at north African nations in general. Germany rejected Amri's asylum application last June, but Tunis initially denied he was a Tunisian citizen, blocking him from being sent home. A new Tunisian travel document for the 24-year-old only arrived two days after the slaughter in Berlin. Several thousand citizens of north African nations, including those with almost no chance of obtaining asylum in Germany, are similarly lacking papers to return home. The Christmas market attack has pushed the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel to consider how to improve the system. Authorities are considering more routinely placing failed asylum seekers viewed as dangerous Islamists in detention ahead of their deportation. \"I will make very concrete proposals to expand the possibility of placing in detention people classified as dangerous before their expulsion,\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas said on Sunday, adding this would apply to failed asylum seekers whose countries were delaying taking them back. Meanwhile, hundreds have protested in Tunisia this weekend against extremist Tunisian nationals who have travelled to fight in countries including Syria, Iraq, and Libya, from returning home.",

        "A Somali man has admitted attacking a US warship in April after mistaking it for a merchant vessel. Jama Idle Ibrahim and five others chased the USS Ashland and opened fire on it before being captured, court papers said. He pleaded guilty to piracy-related charges in Norfolk, Virginia, and faces 30 years in jail. Five other Somalis also face charges over the attack. Prosecutors said it was Norfolk's first piracy-related conviction in 150 years. \"Modern-day pirates must be held accountable,\" said Neil MacBride, prosecuting. After making a deal with the authorities, Ibrahim pleaded guilty to attacking to plunder a vessel, engaging in an act of violence against people on a vessel, and using a firearm during a crime of violence. Both Ibrahim and the authorities had agreed to a 30-year jail term, and he faces a sentencing hearing on 29 November. Earlier this month a judge had dismissed a piracy charge - which carries a mandatory life sentence - against Ibrahim and his five alleged accomplices. The gang had chased the USS Ashland in a skiff in the Gulf of Aden on 10 April, opening fire on it. US Navy personnel returned fire, killing one Somali and wrecking the men's skiff, prosecutors said. But the judge dismissed the more serious piracy charge because the group had not robbed, boarded or taken control of the US Navy ship. Somalia has been ravaged by internal conflict for two decades, and pirates have flourished amid the lawlessness. Foreign countries have generally been reluctant to try suspects in their own countries, so pirates are often allowed to go free after an unsuccessful attack.",

        "The Pentagon has placed an order for a prototype augmented reality display system that is based on dual focus contact lenses with an expanded field of vision. The system, called iOptik and developed by Innovega, allows the wearer to focus on a HUD at the same time as the surrounding environment by projecting an image onto different sections of the lens. HUD information goes through to the center of the pupil, and light from the wearer's peripheral vision is filtered out to avoid interference. The US military already uses HUDs on the battlefield, but they require bulky equipment and the wearer must actively focus on the information displayed. However, iOptik uses a lightweight eyewear system that doesn't look entirely dissimilar to what Google has proposed with Project Glass, and Innovega claims significant performance benefits over traditional HUDs. Speaking to the BBC, Innovega CEO Steve Willey said that the Pentagon contract will allow the company to start prototyping and evolving potential uses for iOptik, with eventual consumer applications such as 3D movies, gaming, and Project Glass-style augmented reality eyewear being proposed. Willey says that iOptik lets you do \"something that humans don't usually do,\" and following the recent 3D \"revolution\" we're not entirely sure that's a good thing. Still, the recent surge of interest in this kind of technology is certainly an intriguing development.",

        "One of the most fascinating and promising developments in genetics is the CRISPR genome editing technique. Basically, CRISPR is a mechanism by which geneticists can treat disease by either disrupting genetic code by splicing in a mutation or repairing genes by splicing out mutations and replacing them with healthy code. Researchers in China at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University have successfully edited genetic mutations in viable human embryos for the first time. Typically, to avoid ethical concerns, researchers opt to use non-viable embryos that could not possibly develop into a child. Previous research using these non-viable embryos has not produced promising results. The very first attempt to repair genes in any human embryos used these abnormal embryos. The study ended with abysmal results, with fewer than ten percent of cells being repaired. Another study published last year also had a low rate of success, showing that the technique still has a long way to go before becoming a reliable medical tool. However, after experiencing similar results with using the abnormal embryos again, the scientists decided to see if they would fare better with viable embryos. The team collected immature eggs from donors undergoing IVF treatment. Under normal circumstances, these cells would be discarded, as they are less likely to successfully develop. The eggs were matured and fertilized with sperm from men carrying hereditary diseases.",

        "A village council in Uttar Pradesh let off an alleged rapist after he touched his victim's feet, according to a report in the Times of India. The charade in the name of instant justice was carried out right in front of the local police. A 30-year-old woman, working at a levelling project under the MNREGA at a forested area in Meergunj, was alone during the lunch hour on January 28 when the 32-year-old accused, Rohtash, allegedly dragged her to an isolated spot and raped her, the report said. The accused threatened to kill her if she raised an alarm. When she went to the Meergunj police station to lodge a complaint, police officials refused to take her seriously. They called up the village head instead, who called for a panchayat or council outside the police station. The accused, Rohtash, was asked to touch her feet and ask for forgiveness. When he did, the panchayat declared him absolved of his guilt and even asked the survivor to stay mum on the crime. When the rape survivor called the superintendent of police, Brijesh Srivastava, he directed the Meergunj police to lodge a complaint.",

        "Recent images from NASA's Earth Observatory show stages of the lake's decline Disaster began with Soviet-era diversion of lake's tributaries for agriculture Rising salinity, chemical contamination furthered the calamity The Aral Sea was once the world's fourth-largest lake. Now much of it is a vast toxic desert straddling the borders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, two former Soviet states in central Asia. In recently released images, NASA's Earth Observatory shows the extent of the lake's recession over the past 14 years. The damage reached its peak this year, when the eastern lobe of the South Aral Sea -- which actually was the center of the original lake -- dried up completely. Until the 1960s, the Aral Sea was fed by two rivers, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which brought snowmelt from mountains to the southeast, and local rainfall. But in the 1960s the Soviet Union diverted water from the two rivers into canals to supply agriculture in the region. With the loss of water, the lake began to recede and its salinity levels began to rise. Fertilizers and chemical runoff contaminated the lake bed. As the lakebed became exposed, winds blew the contaminated soil onto the surrounding croplands, meaning even more water was needed to make the land suitable for agriculture, according to an Earth Observatory release. The falling water levels changed the local climate, too. Without the lake water to moderate temperatures, winters became colder and summers hotter, the Earth Observatory said.",

On Saturday its central committee attempted to contain the anarchy that many believe will erupt in Nablus. Following the dismantlement of Nablus's city council, which was previously presided over by Hamas, Fatah plans to present the leader of its Revolutionary Council, Amin Makboul, as a candidate. But his adversary is also a member of Fatah, Ghassan Shakaa, who served as Nablus mayor two terms ago, before Hamas took control. The members making this claim say that aside from the election of President Mahmoud Abbas to the movement's chair, all other decisions made by the council are tainted with serious corruption that could end up leaving the movement vulnerable to hostile influences.",

As this time the alternative is openly admitted - exiting the euro - people will have a better picture of the choice involved. The recent history of the willingness of Greece to implement its programmes heavily suggests it will not meet the new conditions either, at which time the Grexit issue will return\", says Nordea Bank.

According to the prosecution, the ambulance heading on Tsarigradsko Shosse boulevard to the scene of the horrific Wednesday evening crash in which a taxi cab ram into a group of people standing at a bus stop, has been delayed by 12 minutes because it did not have free access due to the rally and was forced to make a detour.

The video was uploaded to YouTube where it caught the attention of the public and sparked outrage. Marlene Pinnock and her family have both called for the officer to be punished, calling it a clear case of police brutality. An investigation conducted and recently concluded by the CHP has been forwarded to the District Attorney's Office, and Andrew could very well be facing criminal charges, according to a press release. Pinnock has since sued the CHP over the incident. In his own arrest report the officer said he was trying to protect Pinnock from wandering into the freeway, according to the LA Times.

Instead of forgoing opening to the Chinese market, NARS has decided to test products on animals so they can sell in China. Sign the petition to ask NARS to keep their commitment to be cruelty free and choose not to sell in China. Fans of NARS have been speaking up online, especially instagram, about their disappointment in the brand's choice. Many folks use NARS specifically because they have refused to test on animals and those folks are feeling betrayed now. NARS has been a champion of a world with no animal testing for a long time, and this move to change their core values just for their bottom line is unimpressive at best. I personally use some NARS products for this purpose and am really upset that I no longer feel I can support them. There are many safe ways to test cosmetics without using animals and the only way to get countries like China to see that is for companies like NARS to refuse to go along with their laws.",

        "Half of the residents of Illinois would like to leave the state. It's about the same in Connecticut. Meanwhile, few wish to move out of Hawaii, Montana or Maine. That's according to a new Gallup poll released today, a poll that finds Alabama atop fellow southern states. Gallup asked: \"Regardless of whether you will move, if you had the opportunity, would you like to move to another state, or would you rather remain in your current state?\" In Alabama, just 31 percent of respondents said they would like to move away. That tied Florida for the fewest in the South. But when the question was flipped, Floridians were less certain. In Alabama, 69 percent of residents asserted they want to remain in Alabama. And 67 percent said so in Florida. Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas were close behind, all ranked with slightly more favorable responses than the national average. Mississippi and Georgia were closer to the bottom of the list, as 39 percent of residents would leave Mississippi and 38 percent said the same in Georgia. On the whole, most of the South tended to fall near the national average. One third of people across the country want to leave the state they live in. But there is greater variation in other regions. In Maine, Montana and Hawaii just 23 percent of residents would move if they could. Close behind are Oregon, Texas and New Hampshire. At the other of the spectrum, more than 40 percent of residents want to leave Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Nevada and Maryland. And at the very bottom of the list, in Connecticut and Illinois, less than half of the residents would stay if moving was an option.",

My Students Science should be FUN! The Agnes Pflumm books provide students with an opportunity to read about science and the scientific method while truly enjoying what it is they are reading. My students come from a diverse array of backgrounds and cultures. The school I teach in is a Title I school so many of my students come from an inner city home. These 7th graders are eager to learn and are at the perfect age to truly experience science. I see 7th grade as a perfect time to get them excited about science by encouraging them to explore and investigate the world around them. I want these students to have an opportunity to experience science, to do science and to develop a love of science at a young age. I try to incorporate opportunities for each child to experience successful learning and these books provide many students with that success. My Project By utilizing the Agnes Pflumm books, students learn about the scientific method, an essential concept in science, all the while enjoying the experience of reading in the content area. Students start to develop ideas about their own research projects and begin to visualize themselves as young scientists in the making, all the benefits of a true learning experience. Students become problem solvers while learning. These students are tomorrows engineers, technicians, scientists. Inspiring a love of science and learning now, will help them to realize that they can pursue a career in science in the future. Part of inspiring that ambition is to make learning fun.",
        "Perhaps the best-known maritime tragedy of all time, the RMS Titanic was a passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US. The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of 1,514 people in the third deadliest non-military maritime disaster in history. On April 14, 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm. The collision opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea. Over the next two and a half hours, the ship gradually filled with water and sank. Passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partly filled. Just before 2:20 am, the Titanic broke up and sank bow-first with over a thousand people still on board. Those in the water died within minutes from hypothermia caused by immersion in the freezing ocean. The 710 survivors were taken aboard from the lifeboats by the RMS Carpathia a few hours later.",

News media, nevertheless, presented each of these instances of gang rape as exceptional and unique. I interrogate the cultural work conducted by such a narrative of exceptionalism and elaborate on feminist media criticism of this practice. I contend that by covering brutal instances of sexual assault and presenting them as exceptional, news coverage ends up undermining the goals of feminist activism that they seem to uphold. This paradoxical approach by news media is not new but has been amplified by digital media flows and has necessitated new tactics from feminists to combat gender-based violence. I map these toward the conclusion of the chapter.",

The Brazilian full-back sustained the injury during United's 3-1 victory at Fulham on Saturday before being substituted at half-time by manager David Moyes. Rafael reported for training at Carrington this morning wearing a protective boot and will miss the trip to Spain. But Moyes may now be forced to face Premier League leaders Arsenal without a specialist right back if the youngster fails to respond to treatment this week. United's medical staff have yet to rule Rafael out of the Arsenal game, but he is understood to be 'touch and go' for the clash with Arsene Wenger's team, who could move 11 points clear of United with a win on Sunday. If Rafael fails to prove his fitness, Moyes will turn to either Phil Jones or Chris Smalling to fill the gap.

        "Despite having received advice from its own department that disincentives alone - temporary protection visas and offshore processing - would not stop asylum boat arrivals, the government proceeded with that part of the plan anyway. And as predicted, the boats did not stop, nor even slow - so by Labor's own definition its policy was a failure. That leaves the government entering an election year trapped in the worst of both worlds. It is attacked for the ''cruelty'' and inhumanity of conditions on Nauru and also attacked by the Coalition because the boat arrivals are still not slowing. Coalition spokesman Scott Morrison has calculated that more asylum seekers have arrived by boat since Labor came to power in 2007 than the population of Alice Springs - a vivid comparison he can keep updating. In a few weeks it will be Lismore, then Bathurst. By the time of the next election the ''crisis'' of arrivals might be up to Dubbo proportions. So Labor has reached for another solutions harking back to the Howard era - bridging visas for refugees processed onshore that will leave them in a devastating and poverty-stricken legal limbo-world for five years or maybe even longer, in many ways similar to the situation of the people to whom the Howard government gave temporary protection visas.",

If there were any truth to the apocalyptic anxieties of our opponents, life in California would already be a living hell.

If the ridership loss is particularly prevalent among certain socio-demographic groups, then the factors leading to this shift in travel behavior could be identified. If, however, the ridership decline is evenly distributed, then the underlying cause could be a blanket factor affecting all in the same way. Based on this determination, transit agencies would then be able to anticipate future changes in bus ridership and find ways to reverse the trend. They could, for example, decide whether to lure back lost riders with more service or concentrate on other promising market segments.",
        "I would like to take the oxymoron from the abstract of the article that is on the front page: \"competing globally\". It is not possible to compete in a global system. Global world means that the whole human society has become interconnected and interdependent on all levels of human activity, the whole global society has become a single, fully integrated system. While for example in Europe politicians, economists are still arguing about the level of integration they need to save the Union, the system we evolved into comes with \"inbuilt\" full integration. In other words we try to resist the evolutionary conditions we exist, we still pretend as each and every individual and nation would be separate and could do whatever they want. A global, integral system is based on and sustained by full, mutually complementing cooperation. Any ruthless competition the article and other experts still try to pursue is suicidal like preferring a cancer instead of a healthy organ. And this is not even on the theoretical level any more, the evidence is in the news every day, it is in the statistics, in the desperate helplessness of the G8, G20 meetings, any other summit or negotiations. We really have no choice in the matter except adapting to the system willingly or by forced as a result of suffering. If we choose the willing participation, we can unlock such potential in the global, integral and natural system around us that we could not even imagine before. Instead of the constant struggle, failures, waste we could exist effortlessly since we would be partnering the system and not constantly fighting against it.",

The federal government and Idaho agreed to allow a population of 100 wolves into the state, but the Canadian wolf population far exceeds that number now, and is estimated to be 1000 to 2000 wolves that can weigh as much as 140 to 180 pounds. The federal government mismanaged the wolf program under the Endangered Species Act. The wolves are now a very serious threat to humans and livestock because they carry disease and tapeworms. Tapeworms from wolf feces can be fatal to humans; it is especially alarming that tapeworms can remain dormant for 20 years. Phil Hart, working with Dane vonBriechenruardt, director of the US Bill of Rights Foundation and a team of legislators including Judy Boyle, devised a creative plan to protect the people of Idaho: legislation was written to declare a State of Emergency to place the power with the State, removing it from federal agencies. Declaring a State of Emergency can be used as a model for other issues that threaten life and property, and to preserve the 10th Amendment and States' Rights. Just before the State of Emergency bill was to be signed into law, Congress de-listed the Canadian gray wolves, which transferred control from the federal government to the state. It appears that the feds may have wanted to avoid a confrontation over the 10th Amendment. Federal court jurisdiction is limited to federal statutes, so the feds would have had no authority if a State of Emergency was declared under State police power.",

        "The Atlanta Falcons are already searching for a head coach to replace the departed Mike Smith. General manager Thomas Dimitroff's job still isn't all that safe either. Ian Rapoport reported on NFL Network's NFL GameDay Morning that owner Arthur Blank has told people the new head coach will have a say in the future of the GM, according to sources who have spoken to the owner. Until that coach is in place and until the organization decides they are a match, Dimitroff's fate hangs in the balance, Rapoport reported. It's not a shocker to anyone who watched Blank's news conference following Smith's dismissal. The owner wouldn't provide assurances about the GM, who was sitting right next to him on the dais. It was an awkward scene, but clearly Blank was making a point. Dimitroff is a two-time NFL Executive of the Year and respected within many scouting circles. Whether Blank's message to coaching candidates is indication of a forthcoming parting of ways or a reshuffling of front office duties remains to be seen. But it is clear that the Falcons owner isn't sitting idly by and is willing to take any steps to get the coach he desires.

Additionally, following a landmark 1884 ruling that legalized cremation in England, the LNC seized the opportunity to provide transportation services for bodies and mourners to Woking Crematorium via its railway line.

On the other hand, they also find themselves inadvertently perpetuating aspects of whiteness in their own actions and beliefs. This complex dynamic often results in what W.E.B. Du Bois famously termed as \"double consciousness\" - a constant awareness of how they are perceived by society and the internal conflict that arises from reconciling their own identity with societal expectations. In this way, the interplay between resistance and reproduction of whiteness contributes to the ongoing struggle for nonwhite individuals to assert their own agency and redefine their place in a hegemonic society.",
        "Let me tell you about what went down in Camden, New Jersey back in 2013. The place was dealing with a crazy amount of crime and their city budget was in shambles. So, the city officials made a bold move - they got rid of their whole police department, broke up the union, and basically hit the reset button. They decided to try out this new approach called community policing, where the cops and the folks in the neighborhood worked together more closely. They also put more money into public services. And guess what? Crime rates took a nosedive. It was like magic!",

        "I started to really think about my role in relationships and how I may have been selling myself short. I constantly put others' needs before my own to avoid conflict, but it only led to resentment and eventual breakdown of those relationships. It got me thinking - maybe others could sense my resentment, or maybe my behavior just made our relationships superficial and unrewarding. It's possible that my constant accommodation led to my own fatigue and anger, and in hindsight, could have come off as self-righteous and demeaning to others. It was a wake-up call for me, and I knew I needed to make some changes.",

As I delved deeper into the research, I found myself captivated by the idea of these ancient individuals being linked by blood, sharing a common lineage that stretched back through the ages. However, Smith and Brickley's perspective that the similarities could also reflect a small, closely-knit population resonated with me on a different level. It made me consider the possibility of these people living in close-knit communities, bound together by strong familial ties in a world so different from our own. The contrast between these two interpretations left me with a sense of wonder and curiosity about the lives and relationships of these ancient individuals.",

        "The widespread aversion to CAPTCHAs, characterized by the requirement to decipher distorted text in order to prove human identity, is a sentiment widely shared. Often perceived as an inconsequential nuisance, these visual puzzles are notorious for their inscrutability. Moreover, the ineffectiveness of these measures is underscored by the ease with which malicious actors circumvent them. Leap Marketing Technologies has recently introduced NuCaptcha, a novel advancement in this field that utilizes video content instead of static images. NuCaptcha requires users to identify and transcribe a select few characters from the dynamic screen. Leap asserts that human beings possess an inherent ability to make these distinctions, which renders automated reading of the images a formidable challenge. According to a New York Times article from April, the emergence of CAPTCHA reading sweatshops in various countries, driven by spammers, has become a burgeoning trend. NuCaptcha aims to disrupt the economics of such operations by introducing mechanisms that elongate the duration of the video, thereby impeding the efficient resolution of the CAPTCHAs. These features are customizable by the website administrators. While NuCaptcha is not the sole contender in this endeavor, its potential to render CAPTCHA factories unprofitable by impeding their operational efficiency is a compelling prospect.",

        "As the sun began its descent, I navigated my way through the overgrown path, my heart pounding with excitement. In Australia, the focus of clean energy funding should be on research, according to federal independent MP Tony Windsor. He believes that controversial schemes such as \"pink batts or cash for clunkers\" should take a backseat. As a member of the government's multi-party climate change committee, Windsor spent last week immersing himself in clean energy facilities and policy-making in Europe, including a visit to Torresol Energy's 20 megawatt Gemasolar power station near Seville, Spain. Alongside Ross Garnaut and Santiago Anas, he embarked on a quest for renewable energy solutions. Gemasolar's innovative technology uses 2650 mirrors to concentrate the sun's rays onto a central \"power tower,\" heating salt to temperatures exceeding 500 degrees. The molten salts store heat, which is gradually released to power a steam turbine, producing enough electricity to sustain 25,000 households. Notably, Gemasolar achieved a significant milestone last month by becoming the first solar thermal power station to supply electricity to the grid for 24 consecutive hours, including during the night. This marks a crucial test for solar energy's potential to provide baseload power.",

The inclusion of motion controllers with every Vive contributes significantly to the platform's appeal. Additionally, the Vive benefits from the strength and popularity of Steam, as well as the advanced Lighthouse tracking technology, which further enhances its market potential.\n\nHowever, while the Vive offers promising features and potential, the free mini course on creating room-scale and seated VR experiences with the HTC Vive, SteamVR, and Unity falls short in its critical analysis. The course is designed to provide a quick introduction to Vive VR development, aiming to swiftly familiarize users with the development environment and the Steam VR Unity plugin. The course promises to guide users through the basics of receiving input events from the Vive controllers and utilizing them to interact with virtual objects. Yet, the course lacks depth and fails to address the complexities and challenges of VR development, potentially leaving users ill-equipped to tackle more advanced projects.\n\nIn conclusion, the HTC Vive virtual reality system presents an array of strengths, including its partnership with Valve, the inclusion of motion controllers, and the support of Steam and Lighthouse tracking technology. However, the mini course on Vive development fails to provide a comprehensive and insightful analysis, neglecting to address the intricacies of VR development. As such, while the Vive",

It is possible that my parents also considered the future generations, envisioning a smoke-free environment for their potential grandchildren. Their rationale appeared to be rooted in the belief that by shaping my behavior, they could indirectly benefit those around me.

Despite archaeologist Paul Ashbee's observation that the Coldrum Stones are \"Kent's least damaged megalithic long barrow,\" the site has still endured substantial deterioration over the past six millennia since its construction. The eastern side, in particular, has experienced significant collapse, with the stones that once supported the barrow now lying at the base of the slope.

        "As the salvaging of his vessel progresses, Captain Schettino is reportedly residing with his spouse in the coastal town of Meta di Sorrento, near Naples. His trial, wherein he faces charges of manslaughter and deserting his ship, commenced in July in Grosseto, Tuscany, the nearest city to the location of the calamity. Schettino asserts that the rocky reef, which the ship collided with on the night of January 13, 2012, was not indicated on his navigational charts, notwithstanding its presence on tourist maps of Giglio. During the court proceedings, his legal representative refuted the allegation that the captain deliberately abandoned the vessel, instead contending that he had been inadvertently propelled off the ship by accident. Schettino has previously maintained that he unintentionally stumbled into a lifeboat, which was subsequently lowered and ferried him to shore. Schettino's lawyer, Mr. Pepe, asserted outside the courtroom, \"The notion that he deserted the ship is an erroneous interpretation. We seek the revelation of the truth in this trial.\" Schettino alleges that Costa Cruises, the Italian company that owns the ship, has scapegoated him, claiming that executives encouraged him to navigate close to Giglio in order to provide a spectacle for passengers. The legal proceedings are currently in recess for the summer, with the trial scheduled to recommence on Monday, September 23. It is anticipated that up to 700 witnesses and plaintiffs will attend the",
        "The verdant vision of Greens leader Richard Di Natale blooms with the proposal of a direct levy on coal miners, a poetic gesture to fund \"billions of dollars\" in environmental restoration. This lyrical policy seeks to breathe life into former coal mine and storage sites, nurturing them back to vitality. In harmony with nature's rhythm, the plan also aims to nurture the coal industry workers, guiding them towards the clean energy jobs of the future. Dr. Di Natale's unveiling of this transformative plan, set to crescendo in an address to the National Press Club, amplifies its importance as a pre-election marker for the 2016 poll.

        "Carter becomes the fourth defensive starter to land on injured reserve, joining Lee, Church, and Coleman. Scandrick, who had left hand surgery last Friday, remains on the active roster. The Cowboys' linebacker corps, a preseason strength, featured Ware and Spencer on the outside and Lee and Carter on the inside. With a lack of overall roster depth, the team will face challenges in overcoming the losses of their starting inside linebackers. To compensate, Carr and Claiborne will need to step up as shutdown cornerbacks, while the defense may struggle against weaker opponents. This latest defensive setback increases the pressure on Romo and the offense to perform consistently, especially if Murray returns from his foot injury. The Cowboys, currently 5-6, are two games behind in the NFC East and one game out of the final wild-card spot with five games remaining. They will face the Eagles at home this Sunday night.",

        "Bicycles hold a clear advantage over cars in several key areas: they are better for the environment, promote healthier lifestyles, and are more maneuverable in crowded urban areas. However, one major drawback has always been their inability to trigger traffic lights due to their lighter weight. In a forward-thinking move, the City of Rochester has taken steps to address this issue by installing cameras at intersections to detect when a cyclist is waiting and activate the light change process. These cameras are being placed along bike boulevards, a network of interconnected streets designed to provide cyclists with alternative routes to main roads. Rochester has been at the forefront of promoting a bike-friendly culture, implementing various innovations to improve safety and convenience for local cyclists. The recent installation of detection cameras at key intersections, such as Monroe Avenue and Canterbury Road, and Harvard Street and Culver Road, is just the latest example of the city's commitment to the cycling community. According to Erik Frisch, the city's transportation specialist, more cameras will be added as the bike boulevard network expands, with plans for a total of 53 miles. In addition to bike boulevards, Frisch suggests that cameras could also be used at intersections with bike boxes, designated spaces at the front of intersections where cyclists can gain a head start and increased visibility. This proactive approach by the City of Rochester reflects a genuine dedication to creating a safer, more accessible environment for cyclists.",

On one end of the spectrum, you have shoddy single-shot creations that pose a greater risk to the shooter than to their intended target. These makeshift weapons are often crude and unreliable, lacking finesse and precision. On the other end, you have intricate firearms like semi-automatics and fully automatics that demand specialized parts and materials – think custom barrels, springs, and other components that can only be sourced from select suppliers. Not to mention the need for costly machine tools and the expertise of a seasoned machinist or gunsmith to assemble such complex weaponry. \n\nWhat I offer is a happy medium – a middle ground that marries simplicity with functionality. With these instructions at your disposal, you will be able to fashion a 22-caliber revolver that strikes the perfect balance between ease of construction and effectiveness. Get ready to embark on a journey of craftsmanship and ingenuity, where each component you assemble will bring you one step closer to holding a homemade firearm in your hands. Let your creativity and resourcefulness guide you as you follow these step-by-step directions, transforming raw materials into a fully-functional weapon that is uniquely yours.",

The crowd murmured and shifted, their eyes fixed on the Catholic priest as he delivered his impassioned speech. The rally, organized by a group aligned with PEGIDA, reverberated with fervent energy as Spaetling's words echoed through the city streets. But his words, filled with vitriol towards Islam, did not sit well with the diocese of Muenster. In a statement that cut through the fervor of the protest, the diocese condemned Spaetling's comments, effectively silencing his voice in the name of the church.

        "The Pittsburgh Penguins made a bold move by trading Jordan Staal to the Carolina Hurricanes, signaling the end of a successful era for the talented center in Pittsburgh. Despite his crucial role in helping the Penguins win the Stanley Cup in 2009, Staal's reported reluctance to sign a contract extension prompted the trade. This decision not only reunites Staal with his brother Eric in Carolina but also adds another layer of intrigue to the family dynamic with Jared Staal also in the mix. The Penguins received center Brandon Sutter, defenseman Brian Dumoulin, and the eighth-overall pick in the draft in exchange for Staal, ultimately selecting defenseman Derrick Pouliot. The trade not only shook up the draft but also marked a poignant moment for Staal and the Penguins organization, as they bid farewell to a player who had made significant contributions to the team.

        "The notion of standards bodies competing for adoption within industries is an intriguing one, but it is important to recognize that this competition does not adhere to traditional market dynamics. While there may be some overlap in the services offered by different standards bodies, the ultimate goal is for a single standard to emerge as the global norm within a given industry. This means that the competition is not ongoing, and once a standard is established, there is little incentive for further innovation. This lack of continued competition raises concerns about the potential for stagnation within these industries.

        "In a mesmerizing study published in Psychological Science, researchers uncovered the profound impact of awe felt by individuals who witnessed the 2017 solar eclipse. As I delved into the findings, I couldn't help but be moved by the sheer magnitude of emotions experienced by those fortunate enough to be in the eclipse's path. The analysis of nearly 3 million tweets during the eclipse revealed a striking contrast between those within the path and those outside of it. The raw, unfiltered awe expressed by those in the pathway was palpable, reflected in their use of language that was less self-centered and more inclusive. It was awe-inspiring to witness how this overwhelming sense of wonder translated into a more compassionate, humble, and collective way of communicating, transforming their very essence in the process.",
        "The perception of Australians as a caring, friendly, and hospitable people is often challenged by the harsh reality revealed in a recent survey of new migrants. This extensive study, conducted by Monash University, uncovers high levels of ethnic and religious discrimination, painting a stark contrast to the idyllic image often projected. As the Abbott government prepares to dismantle part of the racial discrimination law, the findings of this survey weigh heavily on the collective consciousness. Migrants, it reveals, live in constant fear of walking alone at night and falling victim to crime. This Monday, the survey, funded by the Scanlon Foundation and the federal government, will be released, shining a light on the experience of recent migrants in comparison to the wider Australian population. The results are sobering, exposing a disquieting lack of trust in both their fellow citizens and the political institutions that govern them. Recent migrants, who have made Australia their home over the past two decades, find themselves singled out because of their skin color or faith, further deepening the divide between them and the rest of the population.",

        "World number one Andy Murray has regrettably withdrawn from his inaugural exhibition match at the esteemed Hurlingham Club due to a troublesome hip ailment. Following an early departure from Queen's last week, the esteemed Briton was slated to face off against France's Lucas Pouille at the prestigious Aspall Tennis Classic. Despite this setback, Murray is anticipated to participate in a forthcoming match on Friday as he prepares to defend his Wimbledon crown on the 3rd of July. Notably, the 30-year-old's last appearance at Hurlingham occurred in 2014 subsequent to his early exit at Queen's. Meanwhile, world number two Novak Djokovic endured a brief nine-minute encounter against Canadian Vasek Pospisil at Eastbourne before inclement weather forced a cessation of play for the day. The Serb, making his long-awaited return to pre-Wimbledon competition after a seven-year hiatus, found himself compelled to stave off two break points in his initial service game. Additionally, British contenders Katie Swan and Tara Moore faced disappointment in their Wimbledon qualifying matches. In the discerning view of BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller, Murray's team has characterized his decision as one of \"ultra-caution,\" with plans still intact for his upcoming engagement at the Hurlingham Club on Friday.

        "In 1884, a Bengal tiger supposedly escaped from a travelling circus near Tantanoola in South Australia's south east. Despite a search effort, the tiger was never found. In the years following, there were numerous reports of missing sheep in the area, leading some to speculate that they had fallen prey to the elusive tiger. Eleven years later, a local man named Tom Donovan mistook a Eurasian wolf for the Bengal tiger as it carried a sheep in its jaws. He shot the animal, only to discover that it was not a tiger at all, but a wolf - a creature equally foreign to the Australian landscape. It is believed that the wolf may have been a stowaway on a shipwreck that found its way to shore. The stuffed wolf is now on display at the Tantanoola Hotel. Despite the shooting, sheep continued to disappear from the area for fifteen more years until a policeman from Adelaide discovered the true culprit - a local man was arrested for sheep stealing.",

But how exactly does this phenomenon impact the average household's investment in stocks? The answer lies in the intricate dance between the housing market and stock market, where one's success can often come at the expense of the other.

        "As Fingal unloaded her cargo, Bulloch journeyed to Richmond to meet with Stephen Mallory, the Secretary of the Navy. Mallory enthusiastically approved Bulloch's innovative plan to load Fingal with cotton, which would be sold on the Navy Department's account to fund the purchase of additional ships and equipment in Europe. Upon his return to Savannah on 23 November, Bulloch labored tirelessly for nearly a month to secure a cargo and stockpile enough coal for the journey ahead. Despite a valiant attempt to evade the blockade on 23 December, the Union's tight grip on every passage from Savannah, bolstered by their control of Tybee Island at the river's mouth, thwarted his efforts. By late January 1862, a disheartened Bulloch confessed to Mallory that breaking through was futile. Consequently, Mallory commanded him to relinquish control of the vessel to another officer and seek an alternate route back to Europe.",

        "The titans of finance had finally conceded to a much-needed revamp of their bonus structures for retail staff, a move aimed at restoring faith in their tarnished reputation. However, the announcement was met with a chorus of skepticism, with critics arguing that the changes were merely scratching the surface of the deep-rooted issues within the industry. The Sedgwick Retail Banking Remuneration Review, a document borne out of the Australian Bankers' Association, called for a seismic shift in the way bonuses were awarded, proposing an end to the age-old practice of incentivizing sales targets. Instead, it advocated for a fee-for-service model to replace the hefty commissions pocketed by third party mortgage brokers. Authored by the venerable Stephen Sedgwick, a former public service commissioner, the review was a response to a wave of scandals that had rocked the banking world, from dubious financial advice to aggressive marketing ploys and shady insurance dealings. Against a backdrop of mounting pressure from political quarters, including calls for a royal commission by the ALP and the Greens, the industry found itself at a crossroads, teetering on the brink of a long-overdue reckoning.",

        "The concept of anchoring a feature-length film on the shoulders of a single actor or actress is enough to drive most filmmakers to the brink of madness. It's one thing to create a successful movie with an entire ensemble at your disposal, but it's an entirely different feat to craft something extraordinary - or even bearable - with just one performer. These \"one-man shows\" can be excruciating to endure when they fall flat, once the novelty wears off to reveal a lackluster story or a mediocre performance. Because these films hinge entirely on two crucial elements: the story and the performance. Both must be exceptional, as there are no other distractions to captivate the audience. Once the viewers are disengaged, there's little hope of reeling them back in. However, when executed successfully, this peculiar sub-genre of cinema can be a truly rewarding and unique experience, sometimes even reshaping an actor's career. Admittedly, some of the films on this list technically feature more than one actor - perhaps a cameo or supporting voice actors - but for the most part, the weight of the entire film rests on the shoulders of just one individual.",

        "A recent study led by researchers at the University of Alberta has uncovered the mechanism behind the popping sound that occurs when knuckles are cracked. The study found that the sound is produced by a momentary, vacuum-like gap formed in the lubricating synovial fluid between the finger and knuckle bones when the joints are pulled apart. Lead author and U of A professor Greg Kawchuk suggests that this discovery could have implications for future research in joint health, including the potential for early detection of joint problems. The research team used MRI scans to observe the knuckle-cracking process in slow motion, revealing a brief pocket of darkness between the knuckle and finger bones, as well as a flash of white just before the cracking sound occurs. While the force generated by knuckle-cracking is sufficient to cause damage to a hard surface, medical research has not found any negative effects in individuals who crack their knuckles. Kawchuk, an expert in spinal structure and function, indicates that the study findings may contribute to further research into joint health and arthritic pain. The study is published in the April 15 edition of the journal PLOS ONE.",

        "Germany's threat to withhold development aid from countries that refuse to repatriate rejected asylum seekers reflects a growing frustration with the failings in the deportation process. The case of Anis Amri, the suspect in the Berlin Christmas market attack, serves as a stark example of these failings, as Tunisia initially denied his citizenship, delaying his deportation. This incident has drawn attention to the broader issue of north African nations, where several thousand rejected asylum seekers are unable to return home due to lack of proper documentation. The German government's response to this crisis includes considering the detention of failed asylum seekers deemed to be dangerous, as well as putting pressure on their home countries to expedite their repatriation. Concurrently, protests in Tunisia highlight the concerns over the return of extremist nationals who have fought in conflict zones. This complex web of issues surrounding deportation, national security, and international cooperation underscores the need for a comprehensive reevaluation of the asylum system in Germany and beyond.",

        "He argues that the government's plan to implement tax cuts without identifying new revenue streams is based on the assumption that these tax cuts will be offset by future surpluses. However, the feasibility of achieving a surplus by 2018-19 is highly doubtful, leading to the conclusion that the only way to enact tax cuts without exacerbating the budget deficit would be to further reduce funding for crucial public services such as hospitals and schools. In his view, the true measure of the viability of tax cuts should not hinge on the possibility of future surpluses, but rather on the current fiscal health of the government. Mr. Daley contends that the government could potentially finance tax cuts by slashing existing Commonwealth transfers for education and healthcare, thereby shifting the burden onto the states. However, he dismisses this approach as a lack of leadership, characterizing it as an irresponsible form of cost-shifting that would ultimately harm the most vulnerable members of society.",

        "A Somali man, Jama Idle Ibrahim, has admitted to a startling attack on a US warship in April, after mistaking it for a merchant vessel. Along with five others, Ibrahim chased the USS Ashland and opened fire on it before being captured, according to court papers. He has pleaded guilty to piracy-related charges in Norfolk, Virginia, and now faces a potential 30-year jail sentence. This case marks Norfolk's first piracy-related conviction in 150 years, a significant milestone in maritime law. \"Modern-day pirates must be held accountable,\" stated Neil MacBride, the prosecuting attorney. After reaching an agreement with the authorities, Ibrahim pleaded guilty to attacking to plunder a vessel, engaging in an act of violence against people on a vessel, and using a firearm during a crime of violence. Both Ibrahim and the authorities have agreed to the 30-year jail term, and he awaits a sentencing hearing on 29 November. Earlier this month, a judge dismissed a piracy charge – which carries a mandatory life sentence – against Ibrahim and his five alleged accomplices. The gang had chased the USS Ashland in a skiff in the Gulf of Aden on 10 April, opening fire on it. US Navy personnel returned fire, killing one Somali and wrecking the men's skiff, prosecutors said. However, the judge dismissed the more serious piracy charge because the group had not robbed, boarded, or taken control of the US Navy ship. The situation in Somalia has been dire, with internal",

        "The once lively beaches of Brazil have turned into a tragic graveyard for hundreds of penguins, their lifeless bodies washed ashore. The sight of around 500 of these majestic creatures, found on the shores of Sao Paulo state, has left scientists baffled and deeply concerned. Through painstaking autopsies, they discovered that the stomachs of the penguins were shockingly empty, suggesting a possible death by starvation. As they delve deeper into this harrowing mystery, they are exploring the sinister possibility that relentless strong currents and uncharacteristically colder temperatures may have played a role in their demise. Thiago do Nascimento, a somber figure at the Peruibe Aquarium, believes that the unseasonably frigid waters off the coast could have driven away the penguins' main source of sustenance - the fish and squid they rely on for survival. However, he is haunted by the haunting possibility that overfishing may have cruelly decimated the penguins' once plentiful food sources. The magnitude of this tragedy is not lost on Mr. Nascimento, as he reveals that normally only a handful of deceased penguins are found on the beaches each year. Yet, this year has unleashed an unprecedented horror, with an alarmingly high number of these enchanting creatures meeting a grim fate in a shockingly short span of time.

        "One of the most intriguing advancements in genetics is the CRISPR genome editing technique, which holds great promise for treating genetic diseases. CRISPR allows geneticists to modify genetic code by either introducing mutations to disrupt it or repairing existing mutations with healthy code. Recently, researchers at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China achieved a significant milestone by successfully editing genetic mutations in viable human embryos. In previous studies, researchers have utilized non-viable embryos to avoid ethical concerns, but these attempts have yielded limited success. The initial efforts to repair genes in human embryos using non-viable specimens resulted in only a small percentage of cells being effectively repaired. Subsequent research also showed a low success rate, indicating that the CRISPR technique still requires refinement before it can be considered a reliable medical tool. Despite encountering similar challenges with non-viable embryos, the researchers decided to explore the potential of viable embryos. They obtained immature eggs from donors undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, which would typically be discarded due to their lower likelihood of successful development. These eggs were then matured and fertilized with sperm from men carrying hereditary diseases, setting the stage for further investigation into the effectiveness of CRISPR editing in viable human embryos.",

        "The once tranquil Aral Sea, once the world's fourth-largest lake, now lies in ruins. Its decline began with the Soviet-era diversion of its tributaries for agricultural purposes, leading to rising salinity and chemical contamination. The desolation of this once majestic body of water is evident in the recently released images from NASA's Earth Observatory, showing the extent of its recession over the past 14 years. The damage reached its peak this year, with the eastern lobe of the South Aral Sea - once the heart of the original lake - completely dried up. The lake was once fed by the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, but their waters were diverted for agriculture in the 1960s, causing the lake to recede and its salinity levels to rise. Fertilizers and chemical runoff further contaminated the exposed lake bed. As the water levels fell, the local climate was also affected, with winters becoming colder and summers hotter. The images capture the devastation of a once serene and thriving body of water, now reduced to a vast toxic desert, a stark reminder of the consequences of human intervention in the natural world.",

The anti-euro campaign has recently begun in Greece, and the implementation of the bailout is expected to cause significant economic hardship. It is anticipated that any potential economic recovery will be delayed until 2016 at the earliest. The upcoming elections are likely to further contribute to economic uncertainty and could have a detrimental impact on the economy in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to an increase in anti-bailout sentiment and make it more challenging for the next government to continue with the bailout implementation. As the possibility of exiting the euro is openly discussed, the Greek population will be faced with a clearer understanding of the choices at hand. Given Greece's history of struggling to meet the conditions of its bailout programmes, the issue of a potential \"Grexit\" may resurface. While other Euro-area countries may offer additional concessions on the terms of the bailout programme, if the Greek population becomes sufficiently disillusioned and supports the anti-bailout and anti-euro camp, a \"Grexit\" may become unavoidable. According to Nordea Bank, this scenario may be exacerbated by Greece's historical reluctance to adhere to the conditions of its bailout programmes.",

        "The business model of Internet lending is innovative in its use of point-to-point matchmaking, where investors remit funds to the platform and lend them to the demander through the platform. However, this model also introduces significant capital risk. Firstly, users' funds are deposited in the online loan platform, making the credibility of the platform crucial. Secondly, if the borrower defaults or breaks their promise, it will have a detrimental impact on the online loan platform.

        "Sydney and the rest of NSW are on the brink of a dramatic transformation, with the looming specter of scorching hot days, erratic rainfall patterns, and a heightened risk of devastating wildfires. The first-ever high-resolution modelling of the future climate paints a vivid and unsettling picture of what's to come. Collaborating with researchers at the University of NSW's Climate Change Research Centre, the NSW and ACT governments have delved into the heart of this impending crisis, generating detailed scenarios for 100 square-kilometre grids stretching from south-east Queensland down to the east half of South Australia, forecasting the years 2030 and 2070. The resulting predictions are harrowing: a surge in extreme fire danger days during spring and summer, with Sydney and its surroundings facing a blistering onslaught of heat. The city's previous classification as a climate twin of inland towns like Bathurst is shattered, as all indications point to a marked increase in temperatures across the state. Matthew Riley, director of climate and atmospheric science for the Office of Environment and Heritage, forewarns that cold days will dwindle, especially on the Great Dividing Range, signaling a profound and unsettling shift in the natural order of things.",
